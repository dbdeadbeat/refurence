#Refurence

http://refurence.net - a website for furry character references 


##Setup

###Prerequisites


1. [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) 
  * Using the python3 will prevent the code from running. You can tell which version you're using with `python -V`

2. [VirtualEnv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) and [VirtualEnvWrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) 

3. [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
  * You'll need to set up a database with an admin user for the app to connect to.


###Installation


1. Download via git:

        git clone https://github.com/dbdeadbeat/refurence.git

2. Change into the cloned directory

        cd refurence

3. Create a virtualenvironment

        mkvirtualenv environment

4. Install the required python dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Enter config info in `flask_application/config.py`

6. Set up database

        python manage.py populate_db
        python manage.py populate_data
    
7. Run a development server:
        
        python manage.py runserver


Assuming everything went smoothly, you should now be live on [http://localhost:5000/]

##Usage

###Commands
_Run these commands by using `python manage.py <command>`_


* `reset_db` - Drops all Mongo documents
* `populate_db` - Script to fill the database with new data (either for testing or for initial). You can edit the `populate_data` command in `flask_application/script.py` (Right now it is set up to add Users.)
* `runserver` - Runs a debug server
* `clean` - Removes *.pyc files
* `shell` - Opens a shell within the Flask context
* `show_urls` - Lists the urls that are available
* `run_tests` - Runs unittests using nose.
* Commands included with Flask-Security can be found here: http://packages.python.org/Flask-Security/#flask-script-commands and by looking in `flask_application/script.py`

###Templates
All html templates are stored here in './templates'

###Running Tests
You can run the unittests either with `ENVIRONMENT=TESTING ./manage.py run_tests`, with `ENVIRONMENT=TESTING . /bin/run_tests.sh` or `ENVIRONMENT=TESTING nosetests`.

###Static Content
All static content is stored here in './static'


##TODO List

* Mobile profile editing
* Better copy/paste in editing (parse out style/paste only plaintext)
* Admin portion of site(?) - not sure if worth the effort
* Better utilites for using images hosted on FA
* Better testing
* Add a contact info portion to site
* Whatever is cool; do something cool
* Have a bunch of fun :33333
